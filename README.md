🐍 Spring 2025 ACM Project Hub — snAkeCM
## Project Hub Overview

snAkeCM is a project developed by the Spring 2025 USF ACM Project Hub team. In this project, we’re building our own version of the classic Snake game using Python. However, rather than simply recreating Snake, we’re challenging ourselves to add new, member-suggested twists like walls that switch between being barriers and open paths to make the game more interesting.

This project is designed to help students learn by doing. Instead of traditional workshops, our role is to guide you as you collaborate through Discord and GitHub. By working on this project together, you’ll gain hands-on experience in coding, teamwork, and making documentation.

Our end goal is to showcase the project in a final event where you can present your work. This isn’t just about making a game; it’s about building a project that demonstrates your skills and looks great on your resume, boosting your internship chances and paving the way for future Project Hubs.
